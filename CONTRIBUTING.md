# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Kogn RDF.

## Maintenance status

This project is maintained on a best-effort basis by a single maintainer, in
spare time. Issues and pull requests are read and reviewed as capacity allows —
there is no service-level promise and no guaranteed turnaround. A slow or absent
response is not a judgement on your contribution; it just reflects available
time.

## Before you open a pull request

For anything beyond a trivial fix (typo, obvious one-line bug), **open an issue
first** and wait for a short go-ahead. This protects your time as much as the
maintainer's: a large or unsolicited PR that does not fit the project's scope or
design may not be merged, and it is frustrating for everyone to discover that
after the work is done.

Good candidates that rarely need discussion:

- Fixing a clearly wrong behaviour, with a failing test that the fix makes pass.
- Correcting documentation.

Things to raise in an issue first:

- New public API, ports, or backends.
- Anything touching the design of the term model or dataset ports.
- Dependency additions (note that `rdf-terms` is intentionally
  dependency-free).

## Working on a change

- Branch off `main`; pull requests target `main`.
- Keep pull requests **small and focused** — one concern per PR. Split unrelated
  changes.
- Follow existing patterns in the code; look before you guess.
- Add or adjust tests. Bug fixes start with a failing test.
- Build and test locally before pushing:

  ```bash
  ./mvnw verify
  ```

  This runs the tests and the Spotless check, which enforces the SPDX license
  header on every `.java` file. Run `./mvnw spotless:apply` to add missing
  headers and formatting.

See the [README](README.md) for the required toolchain. Maven comes from the
pinned `./mvnw` wrapper — no local Maven install is needed. Deployment to the
package registry and releases happen exclusively through CI; contributors never
deploy.

## Commit messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`type(scope): subject` (e.g. `fix(dataset): …`). Common types: `feat`, `fix`,
`docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `perf`. Breaking changes get
a `!` after the type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer. The project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## AI-assisted contributions

AI-assisted contributions are allowed. If you use such tools, you remain
responsible for what you submit: understand the change, make sure it is correct,
and test it as you would any other code. Unreviewed machine-generated output is
not a shortcut around the bar above — and large or sweeping AI-generated changes
may be rejected on scope alone, regardless of correctness.

## Licensing

By submitting a contribution you agree that it is licensed under the project's
[Apache 2.0 license](LICENSE). Do not submit code you do not have the right to
contribute under that license.

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue with a minimal reproduction and the expected vs. actual behaviour.
For anything security-sensitive, do **not** file a public issue — use GitHub's
private vulnerability reporting instead ("Report a vulnerability" under the
repository's **Security** tab), which reaches the maintainer privately.
